Broadcom BCM43XX 802.11 wireless device driver PHY MODULE source directory.
This is created in May 2009 from top of tree. These files used to under wl/sys directory

- "dot11" core hardware definitions are in d11.h
- 802.11 protocol definitions are in proto/802.11.h
- driver internal definitions shared between common code and PHY modules
 are in wlc_bmac.h wlc_phy_shim.h

Naming conventions:
The PHY driver prefix is "wlc_phy" .
The common PHY module file is wlc_phy_cmn.c
The specific PHYTYPE dependent files are wlc_phy_xx.c
Registers are wlc_phyreg_xx.h
Tables are wlc_phytbl_xx.[ch]
	many new files are resulted from file split or being moved from other directory like phy/radio register definitions

Interface:
wlc_phy_hal.h is the external interface.
wlc_phy_int.h is the internal shared interface.
