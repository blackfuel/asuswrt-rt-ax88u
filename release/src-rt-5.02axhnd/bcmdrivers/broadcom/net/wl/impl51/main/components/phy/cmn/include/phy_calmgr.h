/*
 * Calibration manager works with calibration modules and controls calibration process.
 *
 * It provides two registries for calibration and other modules to register callbacks:
 *
 * - calibration trigger registry
 * - calibration registry
 *
 * Modules register callbacks in each registry at attach time by calling interfaces provided
 * in this header file in order to participate in the calibration trigger and/or calibration
 * process. See "Add a calibration trigger fn" and "Add a calibration callback entry".
 *
 * The calibration manager queries each registered callback in the "calibration trigger
 * registry" for a decision if it should start the calibration process. The result of
 * these callbacks decides if it is time to start the calibration process.
 *
 * Once a calibration process is started the calibration manager interacts with the registered
 * callbacks in the "calibration registry" and controls the entire calibration process. The
 * calibration process may be done in a single calibration manager invocation or can be broken
 * into multiple phases and be done in multipel calibration manager invocations based on the
 * requested mode. In multiple phase calibration mode the calibration manager is responsible
 * for maintaining the calibration module state (index) needed to run the calibration while
 * each calibration module is responsible for maintaining the phase state (index) across
 * multiple calibration manager invocations.
