/*
 * Public header file for event-component data structure and API
 *
 * This library provides a data structure and behavior for registering
 * interest in events and getting callbacks. The fundamental data structure
 * is an opaque type that servers instantiate. Servers then use function calls
 * to let clients express interest and register callback function pointers.
 * Servers can signal events and provide server-specific data on the event.
 *
 * The library guarantees that client callbacks occur in the same order that the
 * clients registered interest.
