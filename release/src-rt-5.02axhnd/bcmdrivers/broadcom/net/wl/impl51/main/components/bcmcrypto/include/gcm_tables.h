/* Support for various per-key tables.
 *  Shoup's 4 bit tables         - 256 bytes/key - Supported
 *  Shoup's 8 bit tables         - 4096 bytes/key - Supported
 *  Wei Dai (crypto-optimization)- 2048 bytes/key - NOT Supported
 *  Simple 4 bit tables          - 8192 bytes/key - NOT Supported
 *  Simple 8 bit tables          - 65536 bytes/key - NOT Supported
 *
 * Rationale: 4 bit tables are reasonable in terms of memory. 8 bit
 * tables would provide performance comparable to CCM. Wei Dai
 * claims performance equivalent to 8k bytes/key - i.e simple 4 bit and
 * within a factor of two compared to 64k bytes/key - i.e. simple 8 bit
 * Based on comments in openssl 1.0.1c implementation, simple tables
 * seem to be vulnerable to timing attacks...
