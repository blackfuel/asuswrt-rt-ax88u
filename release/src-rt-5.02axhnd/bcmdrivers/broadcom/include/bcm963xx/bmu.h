/*
 * The purpose of this interface is to allow modules to register a callback function
 * with the power management module. The power management module handles an
 * interrupt from the Battery Management Unit (BMU) which triggers each time
 * the system goes from Utility power to Battery power. The purpose of the
 * registering functions should be to power down certain interfaces immediately
 * to avoid exceeding the battery instantaneous current limits.
 * If the battery is capable of sustaining the system load for a long enough time,
 * then there is no need to register with the interrupt handler and instead
 * all the work can be done in userspace through the bmud application.
 * The interrupt does not trigger when going from battery power back to utility
 * power. This can be handled in userspace in collaboration with the bmud application.
